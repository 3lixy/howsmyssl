          <h1>About this site</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">How's My SSL? is a cute little website that's meant to
          tell you how your <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">TLS client</a> (like the web
          browser you're reading this with) is doing.</p>

        <p>How's My SSL? was borne out of my own need to know more about TLS
          clients in the wild while I worked on a web server at my day
          job. It's purpose is to give developers and technically-savvy folks
          a quick an easy way to interrogate their tools and learn more about
          them.</p>
      
        <p>It's also meant to put impetus on developers to improve their tools
          by modernizing their TLS stacks. While it can't possibly detect
          every problem is a TLS client, it can check for many common
          ones.</p>

        <h3 id="rating">Rating</h3>
        <p>How's My SSL? gives a rating to each client that connects to
          it. These ratings are not the final word on "how secure" a client
          is, but merely captures some important aspects of the client.</p>

        <p>Clients are rated as "Probably Okay" if no security problems could
          be detected.</p>

        <p>Clients are downgraded to "Improvable" if they do not support
          ephemeral key cipher suites, do not support session tickets, or are
          using TLS 1.1.</p>
        <p>Clients are downgraded to "Bad" if any of the following are true:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It uses TLS 1.0 (instead of 1.1 or 1.2), or, worse, SSLv3 or
            earlier.</li>
          <li>It supports known insecure cipher suites. Developers can find
            the list of known insecure cipher suites in
            the <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl/blob/master/insecure_suites.go">howsmyssl
            repository</a> on GitHub.</li>
          <li>It supports TLS compression (that is compression of the
            encryption information used to secure your connection) which
            exposes it to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
              attack</a>.</li>
          <li>It is susceptible to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST
            attack</a>. A caveat here: some advanced clients have a
            workaround called "1/n-1 record splitting" that is not yet
            detectable by How's My SSL?. Known clients that do this are
            recent versions of Chrome and Firefox but it is unlikely that
            others do.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How's My SSL? always selects the worst rating the client could
          receive.  That is, clients rated as "Bad" may also have problems
          that, on their own, would have the client rated as "Improvable".</p>

        <h3 id="tls-vs-ssl">TLS vs SSL</h3>
        <p>So, the jargon around these things is weird. When folks refer to
          the
          "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>"
          they are referring to the modern protocols of encrypting data across
          the internet. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>",
          when used by experts, refers to the older versions of these
          protocols. In general, people use "SSL" and "TLS" interchangeably,
          but that's changing towards everyone saying "TLS". TLS is the
          future.</p>
