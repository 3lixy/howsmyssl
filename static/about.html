      </div>
      <p class="lead">How's My SSL? is a cute little website that's meant to
        tell you how your <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">TLS client</a> (like the web
        browser you're reading this with) is doing.</p>

      <p>How's My SSL? was borne out of my own need to know more about TLS
        clients in the wild while I worked on a web server at my day job. It's
        purpose is to give developers and technically-savvy folks a quick an
        easy way to interrogate their tools and learn more about them.</p>
      
      <p>It's also meant to put impetus on developers to improve their tools
        by modernizing their TLS stacks. While it can't possibly detect every
        problem is a TLS client, it can check for many common ones.</p>

      <h3 id="rating">Rating</h3>
      <p>How's My SSL? gives a rating to each client that connects to
      it. These ratings are not the final word on "how secure" a client is,
      but merely captures some important aspects of the client.</p>

      <p>Clients are rated as "Probably Okay" if no security problems could be detected.</p>

      <p>Clients are downgraded to "Improvable" if they do not support
        ephemeral key cipher suites, or session tickets.</p>
      <p>Clients are downgraded to "Bad" if any of the following are true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It uses TLS 1.0 (instead of 1.1 or 1.2), or, worse, SSLv3.</li>
        <li>It supports known insecure cipher suites. Developers can find the
          list of known insecure cipher suites in
          the <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl/blob/master/insecure_suites.go">howsmyssl
          repository</a> on GitHub.</li>
        <li>It supports TLS compression (that is compression of the encryption
          information used to secure your connection) which exposes it to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
          attack</a>.</li>
        <li>It is susceptible to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST
          attack</a>. A caveat here: the first is that some advanced clients
          have a workaround called "1/n-1 record splitting" that is not yet
          detectable by Hows My SSL?. Known clients that do this are recent
          versions of Chrome and Firefox but it is unlikely that others
          do.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(By the way, clients rated as "Bad" may also have problems that, on their
      own, would have the client rated as "Improvable".)</p>

      <h3 id="tls-vs-ssl">TLS vs SSL</h3>
      <p>So, the jargon around these things is weird. When folks refer to the
      "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>"
      they are referring to the modern protocols of encrypting data across the
      internet. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>", when
      used by experts, refers to the first versions of these modern
      protocols.</p>

      <p>How's My SSL? provides a simple HTTP JSON API for developers that
      want to test clients without a browser
      experience: <code>https://howsmyssl.com/a/check</code>.</p>

      <p>The returned JSON hash will have a least these keys, but may include
        more as the the security environment changes. Each of these values
        keys map fairly obviously to the HTML version and
        the <a href="#what-it-means"> about its text can be helpful to
        understand their meaning. The source code
        that <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl/blob/master/client_info.go">gathers
        the client info</a> may also be helpful. All strings returned may
        contain HTML escaped text.</a>

      <p>Let me be a little more explicit. How's My SSL is Open Source
      software and can
      be <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl">found on
