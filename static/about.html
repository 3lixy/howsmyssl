        <p class="lead">How's My SSL? is a cute little website that tells you
          how your <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">TLS client</a> (like the web browser
          you're reading this with) is doing.</p>

        <p>How's My SSL? was borne out of my own need to know more about TLS
          clients in the wild while I worked on a web server at my day job. It
          gives developers and very technically-savvy folks a quick an easy
          way to learn more about the tools they use.</p>

        <p>It's also meant to put impetus on developers to improve the clients
          they build by modernizing their TLS stacks. While How's My SSL can't
          possibly detect every problem in a TLS client, it can clear out many
          of the common ones.</p>

        <hr />

        <h3 class="fragpadded" id="rating">Rating</h3>
        <p>How's My SSL? gives a rating to each client that connects to
          it. These ratings are not the final word on "how secure" a TLS
          client is, but captures important aspects of its security.</p>

        <p>Clients are rated as <span class="okay">Probably Okay</span> if no security problems could
          be detected.</p>

        <p>Clients are downgraded
          to <span class="improvable">Improvable</span> if they do not support
          ephemeral key cipher suites, do not support session tickets, or are
          using TLS 1.1.</p>
        <p>Clients are downgraded to <span class="bad">Bad</span> if any of
          the following are true:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It uses TLS 1.0 (instead of 1.1 or 1.2), or, worse, SSLv3 or
            earlier.</li>
          <li>It supports known insecure cipher suites. Developers can find
            the list of known insecure cipher suites in
            the <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl/blob/master/insecure_suites.go">howsmyssl
            repository</a> on GitHub.</li>
          <li>It supports TLS compression (that is compression of the
            encryption information used to secure your connection) which
            exposes it to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
              attack</a>.</li>
          <li>It is susceptible to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST
            attack</a>. A caveat here: some advanced clients have a workaround
            called "1/n-1 record splitting" that is not yet detectable by
            How's My SSL?. Known clients that do this include recent versions
            of Chrome, Firefox, OpenSSL and NSS. However, not every browser or
            client is up to date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How's My SSL? always selects the worst rating the client could
          receive.  That is, clients rated as "Bad" may also have problems
          that, on their own, would have the client rated as "Improvable".</p>

        <h3 class="fragpadded" id="what-it-means">What It Means</h3>
        <p>How's My SSL has a lot of jargon on it. We're going to discuss the
        sections on its homepage. While it won't help everyone understand all
        of it, those who have a glimmer of an idea of what they mean will be
        better off reading these.</p>

        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="version">Version</h4>
        <p>The Version section discusses the security of the highest version
          of the TLS protocol your client supports. (Formerly, TLS
          was <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">known as "SSL"</a>.)</p>
        <p>TLS 1.2 is latest version of TLS and it is recommended for clients
          to implement. It is the new normal for highly secure websites. TLS
          1.2 provides access to advanced cipher suites that support
          elliptical curve cryptography (large efficiency wins) and AEAD block
          cipher modes (like the very nice GCM cipher suites). Clients using
          may be set to <span class="okay">Probably Okay</span>.</p>
        <p>TLS 1.1 is the second most recent version of TLS. It fixes some
          security problems in TLS 1.0, removing the need for many of the
          workarounds built into clients and servers. Many deployed clients
          and servers of TLS 1.0 do not implement those workarounds and, so,
          TLS 1.1 is a good improvement. However, the modern security
          environment has pushed us to TLS 1.2. Clients using it will be
          marked down to at least
          <span class="improvable">Improvable</span>.</p>
        <p>TLS 1.0 is the first version of TLS, is fairly common in the world,
          and requires workarounds in both the client and server to work
          securely for all cipher suites. TLS 1.0 is also unable to use modern
          cipher suites that offer great security and efficiency. Clients
          using it will be marked as <span class="bad">Bad</span>.</p>
        <p>SSLv3, the last version of SSL, and the first before TLS 1.0, is
          considered insecure. Clients using it or older versions of SSL will
          be marked as <span class="bad">Bad</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="ephemeral-key-support">Ephemeral Key Support</h4>
        <p>The Ephemeral Key Support section says if your client tells the
          service that it supports cipher suites that include an additional
          private key created for each connection to the service. This extra
          key prevents attackers from storing all of your encrypted
          communication with the website, then later gain access to the
          website's private key, and decrypt all of your (and other's) traffic
          to the website. This additional key, however, is expensive to
          transfer, especially without elliptical curve cryptography support
          in the client and server to make the key smaller at the same
          security. Clients with support for ephemeral key cipher suites will
          be defaulted to <span class="okay">Probably Okay</span>. Clients
          without it will be marked as <span class="bad">Bad</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="session-ticket-support">Session Ticket Support</h4>
        <p>Session tickets are a mechanism to speed up resumption of encrypted
          communication with a server. When a client and server first connect
          over TLS, they perform a complicate, time-consuming handshake. This
          handshake lets the client and the server communicate a shared secret
          (basically, a password) without exposing that secret to people
          tapping the line. However, it only allows the client and the
          specific computer that served the client communicate. Since websites
          can (and, often, must) serve their traffic from many physical
          computers, if the client disconnects and reconnects to the website,
          the client could connect to another machine that knew nothing about
          the shared secret. When that happens, the client and server have to
          perform the slow handshake again.</p>
        <p>If the client supports session tickets, the physical machines that
          serve a website's traffic and share a special second key called a
          session ticket key can deterministically generate a secret shared
          with the client called a session ticket. If the client connects and
          reconnects it includes this session ticket and most of the expensive
          reconnection process can be skipped. This is a huge performance
          boost, making users happier.</p>
        <p>However, the session ticket key living on all of the website's
          computers means there is a secret that could be leaked to an
          attacker. Worse, it undermines the security
          of <a href="#ephemeral-key-support">ephemeral key cipher
          suites</a>. Preventing this is often a source
          of <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/11/protecting-data-for-long-term-with.html">important</a>
          <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/forward-secrecy-at-twitter-0">engineering</a>
          <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/06/27/botchingpfs.html">work</a>
          for a security engineer team. Of course, another alternative is for
          the website to simply turn off support for session tickets and
          enable support for ephemeral keys.</p>
          <p>That trade-off between is why How's My SSL will rate clients with
          session ticket support may be set to <span class="okay">Probably
          Okay</span>, but not having it will only have it defaulted to
          <span class="improvable">Improvable</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="tls-compression">TLS Compression</h4>
        <p>TLS compression was a specification of a way to make the metadata
          in the encrypted connection smaller in order to speed up the
          transfer of data across those connections. However, it turns out
          that this kind of technique allows for attackers to learn
          information about the encrypted data if the attackers can make the
          user's computer make connections to the website. In practice, this
          turns out to be easy. This is now referred to as
          the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
          attack</a>. While some clients have mitigations in place, it's been
          determined that the best way to avoid the attack is to completely
          disable to TLS compression entirely. Clients that do so will be
          defaulted to <span class="okay">Probably Okay</span> while clients
          that leave it enabled will be marked
          as <span class="bad">Bad</span>.</p>
        
        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="insecure-cipher-suites">Insecure Cipher Suites</h4>
        <p>This section displayed any cipher suites the client supports that
          are known to be insecure. Insecure cipher suites make it easy for
          attackers to decrypt data on tapped lines, or make it easy for the
          attacker to pretend to be the website, stealing secrets directly
          from the client. Cipher suites are found here for one of many
          reasons.</p>
        <p> The first among these reasons is if the size of the keys created
          by the cipher suite are too small. Small keys are easier to guess
          (or "brute force"), and there are many cipher suites that have been
          defined with far, far too small keys.</p>
        <p>A cipher suite supported by the client will be put here if it
          does not ensure that the server you connected to was actually for
          the website you wanted. Cipher suites are to do so by inspecting the
          certificate the server sends and verifying it trust the other
          entities (called "certificate authorities") that have "signed" the
          certificate. This is called the "certificate authority trust model",
          and if this sounds crazy to you on many levels, you are not
          alone. It's currently the best security we have,
          however. <a href="http://tack.io/index.html">TACK</a> is one good
          attempt to, in a backwards compatible way, replace it.</p>
        <p>A cipher suite may also be added if its a "null cipher suite"
          which is a funny way of saying the cipher does not encrypt the data
          at all. In a truly bizarre set of decisions these were put in the
          SSL/TLS specifications even though offer no privacy or security for
          the user or the web service. These are giant, glowing "rob me" signs
          on the web.</p>
        <p>Finally, a cipher suite can be added here if it is known to be
          obsolete in some way. Currently, some NSS clients (like Firefox)
          will allow for the use of under-specified or broken cipher suites
          that were meant to be killed off after the death of SSLv3 and were
          never really specified well in the first place.</p>
        <p>Any client supporting an insecure cipher suite will be marked as
          <span class="bad">Bad</span>.</p>

        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="unknown-cipher-suites-supported">Unknown Cipher Suites
          Supported</h4>
        <p>This section notes any cipher suites that How's My SSL did not
          recognize. How's My SSL has a very complete knowledge of cipher
          suites both specified and in use. If a cipher suite is known, the
          client is being, well, "interesting", and "interesting" usually
          means broken. Without a specification, a cipher suite has not been
          publicly vetted the community of cryptographers and the vast,
          vast, vast majority of unvetted security systems are entirely
          insecure. Clients supporting unknown cipher suites will be marked
          as <span class="Bad">Bad</span>.</p>
        
        <h4 class="fragpadded" id="given-cipher-suites">Given Cipher Suites</h4>
        <p>This section is one of the most often needed by developers and
          was the original reason I wrote this webapp. It simply prints out
          the standard names of the cipher suites that the client says it
          supports. No rating will be given in this section.</p>

        <hr />
        <h3 class="fragpadded" id="tls-vs-ssl">TLS vs SSL</h3>
        <p>Okay, last thing. The jargon around these things is weird, so let
          me explain a couple of terms. The 'S' in "HTTPS" is the TLS
          protocol. When folks refer to the
          "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>"
          they are referring to the most common of modern protocols of
          encrypting data across the
          internet. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>", when
          used by experts, refers to the older versions of these protocols. In
          general, people use "SSL" and "TLS" interchangeably, but that's
          changing towards everyone saying "TLS". "TLS" is the future, while
          "SSL" is currently what everyone knows.</p>
