  {{if .EphemeralKeysSupported}}
  <p>Great! Ephemeral keys are supported in the cipher suites your client
  supports. You've got protection from global passive observers (who really
  are out there now).!</p>

  {{else}}
  <p>Oh dear. Ephemeral keys are not supported in your client. Without them,
  global passive observers will be able to scoop up all of your encrypted traffic
  and decode it when their attacks or their computers are faster. This is
  actually happening.</p>
  {{end}}

  {{if .SessionTicketsSupported}}
  <p>Good! Session tickets are supported in your client. Services you use
  will be able to scale out their TLS connections much </p>

  {{else}}
  <p>Not so good. Session tickets are not supported in your client. Without them,
  it'll take your connections over TLS longer to work and its harder for
  services to scale out. Generally, clients with ephemeral key support gets
  this for free.</p>
  {{end}}

  {{if .TLSCompressionSupported}}
  <p>Uh oh. Your TLS client is using TLS compression. This is really not good. It
  makes your TLS connections susceptible to the CRIME attack and your
  encrypted data could be leaked!</p>

  {{else}}
  <p>Good. Your TLS client does not attempt TLS compression, avoiding
  information leaks from a CRIME attack.</p>
  {{end}}

  {{if .BEASTAttackVuln}}
  <p>Ick. Your client is probably open to the BEAST attack. It's using version
  TLS 1.0 or earlier and using the CBC mode for its block cipher and that
  leaks information. Fixed in TLS 1.1 and later.</p>
  {{end}}

  {{if .UnknownCipherSuiteSupported}}
  <p>Not good. Your client is using a cipher suite this app doesn't
  recognize. It's not in the standards and almost certainly not secure. Watch
  out.</p>
  {{end}}

  {{if len .InsecureCipherSuites}}
  <p>Oh boy, your client supports cipher suites that are known to be
  insecure:</p>

  <ul>
    {{range $cipherSuite, $reasons := .InsecureCipherSuites}}
    <li>{{$cipherSuite}}: This cipher {{sentence $reasons}}</li>
    {{end}}
  </ul>

  {{end}}
  <p>Cipher suites your client supports:</p>
  <ul>
    {{range .CipherSuites}}
    <li>{{.}}</li>
    {{end}}
  </ul>
