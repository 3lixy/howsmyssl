        <h1>Your SSL client is {{ratingSpan .Rating}}.</h1>
        <p>Check out the sections below for information about the SSL
          client you used to render this page.</p>
        <p><small>Yes, it's really "TLS", but "SSL" is more widely known.</small></p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Version</h2>
          {{if eq .TLSVersion "TLS 1.2"}}
          <p>Great! Your client is using TLS 1.2, the most modern version of TLS.</p>
          {{else if eq .TLSVersion "TLS 1.1"}}
          <p>Enh, your client is using TLS 1.1. It would be better to be TLS 1.2, but
            at least it isn't susceptible to the BEAST attack. But, it also doesn't
            have the AES-GCM cipher suite available.</p>
          {{else}}
          <p>Oh dear, your client is {{.TLSVersion}}, which is very old, possibly
            susceptible to the BEAST attack, and doesn't have the best cipher suites
            available on it.</p>
          {{end}}
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Ephemeral Key Support</h2>
          {{if .EphemeralKeysSupported}}
          <p>Cool! Ephemeral keys are supported in the cipher suites your client
            supports. You've got protection from global passive observers (who really
            are out there now).!</p>
          {{else}}
          <p>Shoot. Ephemeral keys are not supported in your client. Without them,
            global passive observers will be able to scoop up all of your encrypted traffic
            and decode it when their attacks or their computers are faster. This is
            actually happening.</p>
          {{end}}
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Session Tickets Support</h2>
          {{if .SessionTicketsSupported}}
          <p>Good! Session tickets are supported in your client. Services you use
            will be able to scale out their TLS connections much </p>
          {{else}}
          <p>Not so good. Session tickets are not supported in your client. Without them,
            it'll take your connections over TLS longer to work and its harder for
            services to scale out. Generally, clients with ephemeral key support gets
            this for free.</p>

          <h2>TLS Compression</h2>
          {{if .TLSCompressionSupported}}
          <p>Uh oh. Your TLS client is using TLS compression. This is really not good. It
            makes your TLS connections susceptible to the CRIME attack and your
            encrypted data could be leaked!</p>
          {{else}}
          <p>Good. Your TLS client does not attempt TLS compression, avoiding
            information leaks from a CRIME attack.</p>
          {{end}}
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h2>BEAST Attack Vulnerability</h2>
          {{if .BEASTAttackVuln}}
          <p>Ick. Your client is probably open to the BEAST attack. It's using version
            TLS 1.0 or earlier while also supporting a cipher suite that uses CBC for
            its block cipher. That combination may leak information. Fixed in TLS 1.1
            and later.</p>
          {{else}}
          <p>Probably okay. Your client is either not vulnerable
            to the BEAST attack at all, or it supports a newer version of
            TLS that isn't.</p>

        <div class="span4">
          <p>Oh boy, your client supports cipher suites that are known to be
            insecure:</p>
          <ul>
            {{range $cipherSuite, $reasons := .InsecureCipherSuites}}
            <li>{{$cipherSuite}}: This cipher {{sentence $reasons}}</li>

        {{if .UnknownCipherSuiteSupported}}
        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Unknown Cipher Suites Supported</h2>
          <p>Not good. Your client is using a cipher suite this app doesn't
            recognize. It's not in the standards and almost certainly not secure. Watch
            out.</p>
